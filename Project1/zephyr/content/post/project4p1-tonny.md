<h3> Tonny Wong: </h3>

	Duty this week:
	
	We are about to do some analysis on pricing with the the ground rule of:
		- The origin of the blog content must be hosted from one or more service on AWS
		- Users may connect to a third-party service and that third-party can get the 
		  content from AWS but content should be pprovided to the third-party over HTTPS.
		- Only the production version of the site needs to be running.
		- Access must still be over HTTPS and  include HTTP2.0
		- DNS should still go through AWS Route53 and the current three DNS names should still be valid.

	Duties done this week:
		
	We were task to do calculations over the AWS which we found necesary information to finish calculating certain information that needed
	to be in detail. I have also started to work on my own in creating a website doing Project 0 - 3 for practice purposes. In which I have
	purchased already a Domain called "honeyroselove.xyz" and reading information over the things I did not work on the last projects to get a more
	clarified view on how everything comes into pieces. So for project 4 I have been task to provide information and possible third-party services
	in order to clasify the princes of each individual third party necesities. Such as using the basics of CircleCI, DataaDog, etc... Which basic uses 
	are tend to be free and nothing to charge on the other hand business use of these third-party services aquired well over 100/monthly + from whar
	I have seen the pricing for these services.
