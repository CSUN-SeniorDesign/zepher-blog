For Project 4, I did not have a specific assigned task. I showed up for 3 of the 4 presentation days, but unfortunately fell ill on the last day and could not attend. I took personal notes for the presentations I was present for, however my other team members handled the bulk of note taking that would be our public reference.

When it came to research, once again most of the work was handled by other teammates. I was able to contribute by adding some definitions and making small edits. The most I contributed however, was the diagram for the project. Basing my information on what we worked on for Project 2 and a diagram I found online, I created a simplified diagram which detailed our web hosting. It starts with DNS resolution using Route 53 that connects to our Content Delivery System. This system connects to both our S3 Bucket which contains the resources and static content for the site, but also to our loud balancer. From here it connects to our EC2 Web Server and our Database Server. Originally my mockup included multiple EC2 web servers as well as multiple EC2 application servers, but we deemed this overzealous at this time and went with the much more simple, single EC2 web server design. This is just the general mockup however, based on our work for Project 2, and will likely change in the future to suit the needs of the project that we choose.

As a side note, I also created a resume for the first time in my life. I looked up a template and found a website that walked me through the process which made it quite easy. I also got my sister, who had recently updated her own to look mine over and make sure it was ok. Unfortunately, I realized the site was subscription based and would not let me download or print the document I created, forcing me to recreate it in Microsoft Word to avoid having to pay, but the resultant document was perfectly fine in my opinion.
