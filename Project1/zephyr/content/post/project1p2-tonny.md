					•	If the user already has the files make sure to update the file by:
			o	Git pull origin master
					This will update the hugo site so that the files would not corrupt each other when files push to the github.
					We have used these commands to setup the hugo folder:
					•	Git init
					•	Git clone <clone link>
					Then we go to our destined hugo blog and create a post.
					After creating a post we would want to submit it to git hub:
					•	Git branch <name of branch>
					•	Git checkout <name of branch>
					•	Git add . 
					•	Git status
						o	To verify the new updates on the branch
					•	Git commit -m “<message>”
