      <description>Daniel Hirahoka:  - For Project 1 I was assigned the task to assist with deleting the Route53 information in order to prepare for Project 1. After doing so I was additionally tasked with working and researching Ansible in order to complete the Ansible portion of the Project. So for the next couple of days I looked into installing and setting up virtual machines on my computer in order to practice and see how Ansible would work.</description>

      <description>For second week of project, I was tasked to install Nginx web server on our EC2 instance created by Hayden. For Nginx to communicate through HTTP/HTTPS I had to add few rules into the firewall-ufw so that communication between internet and web server is possible. After installing Nginx I started working on creating a tutorial documentation that goes through how to set up a VPC in AWS, how to create public subnets and private subnets; how to create route tables, how to associate the subnets into appropriate route table, and how to add a new rule in public route able so that communication from outside is accepted.</description>

      <description>The second week of Project Zero consisted of finalizing and finishing what needed to be done to begin the final tasks of documentation and the presentation. I went forth and did route 53 for the project. To setup the domain I had to log into the AWS IAM account and then find where the Route 53 option was. After finding the Route 53 section in services I had to create a Hosted Zone that would be linked to our Domain that we had purchased from Godaddy.</description>

      <description>For Week 2 of Project 0, I was assigned the task of setting up the Elastic Cloud Computer (EC2) server for our website. I have had experience setting up Linux and Ubuntu virtual machines on Oracle VM in the past, but never on AWS. Thankfully though, the procedures were mostly the same and intuitive. I kept most things default but changed a few key features to suit the needs of our group’s project.</description>

      <description>For the second week of project 0, I have found out that the Hugo server will be held in Ubuntu. So I installed Hugo for the Ubuntu instance. The first attempt to move the files from my Windows version of Hugo to Ubuntu is through the zip file and proceed to unzip the files in the site. When I tried to run the Hugo server it seems that there was errors all over the theme files and did not run the Hugo server properly.</description>

      <description>Hayden Wilcox:
At the beginning of Project 0, my main issue was my lack of knowledge with the programs and systems we are supposed to be using. This presented me with my first task: to familiarize myself with them. Specifically, I was tasked with learning how to utilize GitHub and Git, to the extent that I could teach my teammates. To begin, I made accounts for GitHub, Amazon Web Services and Slack.</description>

      <description>Tonny Wong:
For Project 0 i was placed as the group leader and have created tasks for the team members to select. I have placed myself to create the blog and as I was creating the blog i have encountered issues such as packet and commands that were invalid on my computer because I have to download these packets to continue further with the blog. At a point some of the commands were unknown for the command prompt so I have downloaded cmder to solve this issue, having to carefully track my steps so that I would not repeat any unnecessary steps that required more time.</description>

      <description>Daniel Hirahoka:
When beginning Project 0 I was tasked to read and Identify the requirements for the Slack component of the Project. Not much was required to set up the Slack account as the link was provided for the room. After clicking the link and setting up an account I then proceeded to create a channel for our team to communicate in. Creating this channel was straight forward, all I had to do was click the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign near the channels tab and fill in some information that would help us identify this was meant for our team.</description>

      <description>Neel Patel:
Beginning of project, first thing I create was an organization for AWS to link all four AWS accounts of team members into one single AWS account. By putting all the account into an organization, we are able to spend $500 credits instead of single $100 credit we as student get from AWS Educate. After that, I purchased a domain (Zephyr90.com) from godaddy since I was familiar with it. After that started working on creating the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) which create a virtual network for us and to install instances inside that VPC.</description>
