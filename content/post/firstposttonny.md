Tonny Wong:<br>

For Project 0 i was placed as the group leader and have created tasks for the team members  to select. 
I have placed myself to create the blog and as I was creating the blog i have encountered issues such as packet and 
commands that were invalid on my computer because I have to download these packets to continue further with the blog. 
At a point some of the commands were unknown for the command prompt so I have downloaded cmder to solve this issue, 
having to carefully track my steps so that I would not repeat any unnecessary steps that required more time. 
Once the hugo website was established, I have used Hugo server in order to verify the blog in localhost : 1313. 
Nothing would appear due to not having a theme yet so we decided to use the lamp-hugo theme and clean it up as much 
as possible and understand where all the post would be read through which was on the content file of the file created 
by hugo. Then i have placed all of the post into our blog through the content file and separated them by adding new 
post using: “hugo new post/<name of the file>”. After adding all of the post, all the blog files was then sent to the 
designated repository through cmder.
