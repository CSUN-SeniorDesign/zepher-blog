Hayden Wilcox:<br>

At the beginning of Project 0, my main issue was my lack of knowledge with the programs and systems we are supposed 
to be using. This presented me with my first task: to familiarize myself with them. Specifically, I was tasked with 
learning how to utilize GitHub and Git, to the extent that I could teach my teammates. To begin, I made accounts for 
GitHub, Amazon Web Services and Slack. Slack was easy to learn as it is similar in style to a program I use daily called 
Discord. I haven’t done too much with AWS aside from register for the education program, gaining my credits, and signing 
on to the organization created by one of our group members. GitHub was where the majority of my efforts went into this 
week. I have used GitHub in the past to download mods for games and the like, but never personally made an account or 
uploaded anything to it. Thankfully, there are numerous guides to be found, both on the site itself and from outside 
sources. The site’s guide made learning the program easy; creating new repositories (which I learned were the name of
projects) is simple and creating new branches, editing them and merging them is easy. I especially enjoy the fact that 
when approving a pull request, you can easily see what the differences between the master version and the branch version 
are. After familiarizing myself with the site, I then had to download and learn the Git commands. Thankfully, it meshed 
well with the Windows Command Console, which made setting it upsimple. Learning it was once again a matter of finding 
the right guides. After studying a “cheat sheet” of all the commands, following a guide and receiving some help from 
he professor, I was able to replicate what I had done on the GitHub site in the Git command console, editing and merging 
repositories from the site itself.
