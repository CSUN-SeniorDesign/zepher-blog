Daniel Hirahoka:<br>

When beginning Project 0 I was tasked to read and Identify the requirements for the Slack component of the Project. 
Not much was required to set up the Slack account as the link was provided for the room. After clicking the link and 
setting up an account I then proceeded to create a channel for our team to communicate in. Creating this channel was 
straight forward, all I had to do was click the "+" sign near the channels tab and fill in some information that would 
help us identify this was meant for our team. Afterwards I proceeded to do the Individual parts of the Project, creating 
a Github account and Amazon Web Services account, where both had the standard procedure of account creation. After the 
Github account I also requested for the education packet as well as the education program that AWS offered. I received 
the Github package but as of writing this post am still waiting on the credit that AWS offers for students.
The next task that needs to be done is the TLS certificate which consists of collaborating with Neel who purchased 
our domain and taking the steps needed to obtaining the certificates through "Let's Encrypt". I didnâ€™t really encounter 
many issues with what I was tasked to do but I did want to familiarize myself with many of the other components that my 
team was working on. So after finishing up what I had to do and researching a little bit of the TLS certificate I went 
on to practice doing what my team members were tasked to do and doing a bit of personal research on the other components 
of the Project 0.
